## 🚀 Introduction

**Geek Code Breaker** is a modern, high-fidelity logic puzzle web application inspired by the classic board game *Mastermind*, reimagined with a deep "Cyberpunk" aesthetic.

Players assume the role of a system intruder (Hacker), tasked with breaching 100 layers of security firewalls. Using pure logic, deduction, and pattern recognition, you must crack the color-coded encryption sequences within limited attempts.

This project is built as a showcase of **Modern Frontend Engineering**, demonstrating how to build a production-grade application with complex state management, real-time cloud synchronization, AI-assisted analytics, and high-performance rendering.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎮 Immersive Gameplay Experience
*   **100-Level Progression System**: A meticulously designed campaign mode with 100 levels.
*   **Dynamic Difficulty Scaling**:
    *   **Novice (Levels 1-10)**: 3-slot sequences to learn the basics.
    *   **Hacker (Levels 11-40)**: 4-slot sequences introducing standard difficulty.
    *   **Expert (Levels 41+)**: 5-slot sequences requiring advanced logical deduction.
*   **Milestone Challenges**: Every 10th level is a "Security Core" milestone, featuring unique visual cues and serving as a testament to your skills.

### 🧠 Intelligent AI Assistant
*   **Real-time Entropy Analysis**: The built-in AI (`AIAnalytics.tsx`) calculates the **Information Entropy** of the current board state in real-time, visualizing the "chaos" remaining in the system.
*   **Smart Deduction Engine**:
    *   Analyzes your entire guess history.
    *   Identifies **"Strong Candidates"**: Colors that are mathematically likely to be part of the solution.
    *   Flags **"Dead Colors"**: Colors that have been logically proven to not exist in the sequence.
*   **Emotional AI Personality**: The AI assistant reacts to your gameplay with dynamic moods (Thinking, Happy, Sad, Neutral), adding a layer of companionship to the solitary hacking experience.

### ☁️ Cloud Synchronization & Identity
*   **Hybrid Storage Architecture**:
    *   **Local First**: Game progress is instantly saved to `localStorage` for zero-latency updates.
    *   **Cloud Backup**: Asynchronously syncs progress to a **Supabase PostgreSQL** database.
*   **Seamless Session Roaming**:
    *   Play anonymously on a new device.
    *   Register/Login to an account later.
    *   **Smart Merge**: The system automatically detects and merges your anonymous progress into your cloud account upon login, ensuring no data is ever lost.

### 🎨 Cyberpunk Design System
*   **Tailwind CSS Powered**: A bespoke dark-mode design system (`designSystem.ts`) featuring:
    *   Deep indigo/slate gradients (`bg-slate-950`).
    *   Glassmorphism effects on cards and panels.
    *   Neon accents for interactive elements.
*   **Responsive & Accessible**: Fully optimized for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile viewports with touch-friendly targets.

### 🔊 Audio Synthesis
*   **Web Audio API**: Instead of loading static MP3 files, the game uses the browser's native `AudioContext` to synthesize sound effects (oscillators, gain nodes) in real-time. This results in:
    *   Zero network latency for audio.
    *   Extremely low memory footprint.
    *   Dynamic pitch modulation based on game events.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Category | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core** | **React 18** | UI Library (Hooks, Functional Components) |
| **Language** | **TypeScript 5** | Strict type safety for complex game logic |
| **Build** | **Vite 6** | Next-gen frontend tooling, instant HMR |
| **Styling** | **Tailwind CSS 3.4** | Utility-first styling with `clsx` & `tailwind-merge` |
| **Backend** | **Supabase** | Auth, Database, and Row Level Security (RLS) |
| **Icons** | **Lucide React** | Consistent, lightweight SVG iconography |
| **Routing** | **React Router 7** | Client-side routing management |

## 🕹️ Gameplay Guide

1.  **The Objective**: Deduce the hidden color code generated by the security mainframe.
2.  **Making a Guess**:
    *   Tap the colored spheres at the bottom of the control panel to fill the empty slots.
    *   You can change your selection before submitting.
3.  **Deciphering Feedback**:
    *   Upon submission, you receive "Data Bits" (feedback pegs):
    *   ⚫ **Black Bit**: One of your colors is **Correct** and in the **Correct Position**.
    *   ⚪ **White Bit**: One of your colors is **Correct** but in the **Wrong Position**.
    *   **Empty**: The color does not exist in the code at all.
4.  **Strategy**: Use the feedback to narrow down possibilities. If you get 2 Black Bits and 2 White Bits, you know all 4 colors are correct, but 2 need to swap places.
